<h2>Data Processed and Purposes of Processing</h2>
<p>
Dataloop collects and processes two kinds of personal data: Customer Information and Client Information.
</p>
<p>
Customer Information is information that we receive from you, or from a third party at your direction, about your data subjects. We collect only the Customer Information that you provide to us or direct us to collect in order to provide services to you. Customer Information may include personal data about different types of individuals, including: consumers, employees, patients, students, donors, volunteers, business clients, suppliers and other business partners. Such personal data may include basic contact information, such as name, postal address, email address and phone number, as well as more sensitive personal data, such as financial information, personal health information, clinical trial data, demographic information, purchase information, market-research information, and employee and student performance information. Indeed, Dataloop may obtain any type of data about any type of individual that you upload to our products, send to us through online or offline mechanisms, or direct us to collect from third-party aggregators, such as Dun & Bradstreet.
</p>
<p>
We operate under the assumption that it is your obligation as a data controller to notify individuals whose personal data may be included in your Customer Information about the personal data you collect and the purposes for which you collect it, to obtain their consent to our processing of their personal data, where required, and to ensure that such personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current. We have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data is included in Customer Information we process.
</p>
<p>
We collect and process Customer Information only for the purpose of providing services to you and in accordance with our agreements with you. In certain situations, we may supplement Customer Information provided by you with information from other sources. This is done only when you specifically request, and we agree to, such supplementation. This supplementation of Customer Information is for the sole purpose of providing services to you. We will retain Customer Information for the duration stipulated in our agreement with you, or longer, as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.
</p>
<p>
Client Information is personal data about people in your organization, such as account managers and users, who interact with Dataloop’s Hosted Managed Services and its systems. Client Information usually is limited to name, work email address, work phone number and job title. We collect Client Information through online forms, email, phone and other written means that you use to provide it to us. We use Client Information to support your account, maintain our business relationship with you, respond to your inquiries and perform accounting functions
</p>
<p>
Client Information may also include User Information. User Information is information generated by computers that interact with our systems. User Information may be collected through the following:
</p>
<p>
Web server logs/web analytics. In the process of administering this site, we maintain and track usage through web server logs and may use web analytic tools to review log information. These logs provide information, such as what types of browsers are accessing our sites, what country the access request is originating from, what pages receive high traffic and the times of day our servers experience significant load. We use this information to improve the content and navigation features of our sites. Aggregated forms of this data may be used to identify future features and functions to develop for the site and to provide better customer service.
Cookies and other tracking technologies. There are various tracking technologies, including "cookies," which can be used by us to provide tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.

By using those systems, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your system.

We may also use User Information to help us prevent and detect security threats, fraud or other malicious activity, and to ensure the proper functioning of our products and services..
</p>
<p>
Dataloop may additionally use Customer Information and Client Information for the following purposes:
</p>
<p>
To maintain and upgrade a system. Our technical staff may require periodic access to services data that may include Customer Information or Client Information, to monitor system performance, test systems, and develop and implement upgrades to systems. Any temporary copies of such services data created as a necessary part of this process are maintained only for time periods relevant to those purposes.
To address performance and fix issues. On occasion, we may develop new versions, patches, updates and other fixes to our programs and services, such as security patches addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities. In accordance with the terms of your order for services, we may remotely access a user’s computer, while that user observes, in order to troubleshoot a performance issue.</p>
<p>
To meet legal requirements, Dataloop may be required to provide personal data to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements when we believe, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or to respond to a government request.
Third-Party Websites
</p>
<p>
If requested by you, and agreed to by Dataloop, Dataloop Hosted Managed Services systems may be configured to enable you and your users to access other third-party websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Dataloop. If you or your data subjects submit personal data to any of those websites, such information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you and your data subjects to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you or your data subjects access through our systems. Depending on your country, you may also have the right or choice to: (4) restrict or object to processing of the data, (5) receive the data to transmit it to another company (5) withdraw any consent provided, and/or (6) lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.

With respect to Customer Information, we operate under the assumption that it is your obligation as data controller to provide your data subjects a means of accessing their data and requesting that such data be corrected, amended or deleted. Under our current business model, we have no direct interaction with your data subjects and so have no direct way for them to submit these requests to us. If you are a Dataloop Hosted Managed Services customer, and you receive such a request from a data subject about whom we host personal data, and you would like our assistance in responding to that request, please contact our privacy office at helloworld@dataloop.mx or Legal Division/Privacy Officer, Dataloop Hacienda Vegil 402, Jardines de la Hacienda, Querétaro, QRO 76180.

We will not share, sell, rent or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any Customer Information collected by us, unless you direct us to do so and have the appropriate authorization to do so.

Security policies. We design and support our products and services according to documented security policies. Each year, we assess our policy compliance and make necessary improvements to our policies and practices.
Employee training and responsibilities. We take certain steps to reduce the risks of human error, theft, fraud and misuse of our facilities.

We also have assigned to an individual the responsibility to manage our information security program.
Access control. We limit access to Customer Information to only those individuals who have an authorized purpose for accessing that information. We terminate those access privileges following job change or termination.
Data encryption. All electronic transfers of non-public Customer Information between you and Dataloop (including sensitive personal data and sign-on credentials) are required by Dataloop to be done through encrypted connections.
